what least number should be added to 1022 , so that the sum is completely divisible by 25 ?
a ) 4 , b ) 3 , c ) 2 , d ) 0 , e ) 5
assistant
To find the least number that should be added to 1022 to make it completely divisible by 25, we can divide 1022 by 25 and look at the remainder.

\[ 1022 \div 25 = 40 \text{ remainder } 22 \]

This means when you divide 1022 by 25, you get a quotient of 40 and a remainder of 22. To make the number completely divisible by 25 (i.e., no remainder), we need to add enough to reach the next multiple of 25. 

Since the remainder is 22, we need to add \(25 - 22 = 3\) to 1022 to make it completely divisible by 25.

Rationale: By dividing 1022 by 25 and identifying the remainder, we determine how much more is needed to reach the next whole multiple of 25.

a number x is multiplied by 7 , and this product is then divided by 3 . if the positive square root of the result of these two operations equals x , what is the value of x if x ≠ 0 ?
a ) 25 / 9 , b ) 7 / 3 , c ) 5 / 3 , d ) 3 / 5 , e ) 9 / 25
assistant
Rationale: To find the value of \(x\) under the given conditions, let's express the operations algebraically and solve for \(x\). According to the problem, we have:

1. Multiply \(x\) by 7: \(7x\)
2. Divide the result by 3: \(\frac{7x}{3}\)
3. The positive square root of the result equals \(x\): \(\sqrt{\frac{7x}{3}} = x\)

We can solve this equation to find \(x\).

\[
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{\frac{7x}{3}} &= x \\
\Rightarrow \frac{7x}{3} &= x^2 \\
\Rightarrow x^2 - \frac{7x}{3} &= 0 \\
\Rightarrow 3x^2 - 7x &= 0 \\
\Rightarrow x(3x - 7) &= 0
\end{align*}
\]

From here, we see that \(x = 0\) or \(3x - 7 = 0\). Since it's specified that \(x \neq 0\), we ignore \(x = 0\) and solve:

\[
3x - 7 = 0 \\

a money lender finds that due to a fall in the annual rate of interest from 8 % to 7 1 / 5 % his yearly income diminishes by rs . 61.50 . his capital is
a ) 22.378 , b ) 37.78 , c ) 76.88 , d ) 27.888 , e ) 12.771
assistant
Rationale: To find the capital based on the decrease in income due to a fall in the annual rate of interest, we can use the formula: Decrease in Income = Capital * (Old Interest Rate - New Interest Rate) / Old Interest Rate.

Let's convert the rates into decimals for easier calculation:
- Old Interest Rate = 8% = 0.08
- New Interest Rate = 7 1/5% = 7.2% = 0.072

Given that the decrease in income is Rs. 61.50, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[61.50 = \text{Capital} \times (\frac{0.08 - 0.072}{0.08})\]

Solving for Capital:

\[61.50 = \text{Capital} \times \frac{0.008}{0.08}\]

\[61.50 = \text{Capital} \times 0.1\]

So,

\[\text{Capital} = \frac{61.50}{0.1} = 615\]

a train 125 m long passes a man , running at 5 km / hr in the same direction in which the train is going , in 10 seconds . the speed of the train is :
a ) 10 km / hr , b ) 50 km / hr , c ) 14 km / hr , d ) 17 km / hr , e ) 77 km / hr
assistant
Rationale: To find the speed of the train, we first need to understand that the man's speed does not affect the relative speed between the man and the train because they are moving in the same direction. The key here is to use the time it takes for the train to pass the man and the length of the train to calculate the relative speed between the train and the man. We can convert all speeds into the same unit (m/s or km/h) for consistency.

Given:
- Length of the train = 125 m
- Time taken to pass the man = 10 seconds
- Speed of the man = 5 km/hr

First, let's convert the man's speed from km/hr to m/s to match the units with the train's length and time.
\[5 \text{ km/hr} = 5 \times \frac{1000}{3600} \text{ m/s} = \frac{5}{3.6} \text{ m/s}\]

Next, we calculate the relative speed between the train and the man in m/s using the formula:
\[ \text{Relative Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
\[ \text{Relative Speed} = \frac{

a man can do a piece of work in 5 days , but with the help of his son , he can finish it in 3 days . in what time can the son do it alone ?
a ) 5 , b ) 5 1 / 2 , c ) 7 1 / 2 , d ) 6 , e ) 9 1 / 2
assistant
Rationale: We'll use the concept that work rates add when two people are working together. Let's denote the rate at which the father works as \(F\) (work per day) and the rate at which the son works as \(S\) (work per day). The combined rate is \(F + S\).

Given that the father can complete the work in 5 days, we have:
\[F = \frac{1}{5}\] 

When they work together, they can complete the work in 3 days, so:
\[F + S = \frac{1}{3}\]

Substituting the value of \(F\) into the equation gives us:
\[\frac{1}{5} + S = \frac{1}{3}\]

Solving for \(S\) to find the rate at which the son works gives us:
\[S = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{5-3}{15} = \frac{2}{15}\]

This means the son can complete \(\frac{2}{15}\) of the work per day. To find out how many days (\(D\)) it takes for him to complete the work alone, we set up the equation:
\[S * D = 1\

how many three - digit numbers are divisible by 6 in all ?
a ) 149 , b ) 150 , c ) 151 , d ) 166 , e ) none
assistant
Rationale: To find out how many three-digit numbers are divisible by 6, we need to identify the range of three-digit numbers that meet this criterion. A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. 

The smallest three-digit number divisible by 6 is 102 (6 * 17), and the largest is 996 (6 * 166). To find the total count, we use the formula for finding the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: 

\[ \text{Number of terms} = \frac{\text{Last term} - \text{First term}}{\text{Common difference}} + 1 \]

In this case, the first term \(a_1\) is 102, the last term \(a_n\) is 996, and the common difference \(d\) is 6 (since we're counting every multiple of 6).

\[ \text{Number of terms} = \frac{996 - 102}{6} + 1 = \frac{894}{6} + 1 = 149 + 1 = 150 \]

oil cans x and y are right circular cylinders and the height and radius of y are each 5 times those of x . if the oil in can x filled to capacity sells for $ 1 , how much does the oil in y sell for if y is only 1 / 5 th filled ?
a ) $ 25 , b ) $ 26 , c ) $ 27 , d ) $ 28 , e ) $ 30
assistant
Rationale: First, let's determine the volume relationship between the two oil cans. The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula \(V = \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. Given that the height and radius of can Y are each 5 times those of can X, the volume of can Y relative to can X would be:

\[ V_Y = \pi (5r)^2 (5h) = 125 \pi r^2 h \]

This shows that the volume of can Y is 125 times that of can X. 

Since can X is filled to capacity and sells for $1, the price per unit volume is $1/Volume(X). To find out how much oil in can Y sells for when it is only \(1/5\) filled, we need to calculate the volume of \(1/5\) of can Y and then apply the price per unit volume.

The volume of \(1/5\) filled can Y is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 125 \pi r^2 h = 25 \pi r^2 h \]

a ) 756 , b ) 642 , c ) 492 , d ) 372 , e ) 250
assistant
Rationale: To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many digits are required for each page from 1 to 250.

- Pages 1 through 9 use 1 digit each. So, \(9 \times 1 = 9\) digits.
- Pages 10 through 99 use 2 digits each. There are \(99 - 10 + 1 = 90\) such pages, so \(90 \times 2 = 180\) digits.
- For pages 100 to 250, each page uses 3 digits. There are \(250 - 100 + 1 = 151\) such pages, thus \(151 \times 3 = 453\) digits.

Adding these up: \(9 + 180 + 453 = 642\) digits.

a ) 223 , b ) 376 , c ) 250 , d ) 378 , e ) 271
assistant
Rationale: We can solve this problem by breaking it down into steps. First, we need to find Susan's original speed. Then, we can use the information about how increasing her speed by 10 km/hr affected her arrival time to calculate the total distance between City A and City B.

Step 1: Calculate Original Speed
In the first two hours, Susan covered 80 km. Since speed is distance divided by time, her original speed (S) can be calculated as follows:
\[ S = \frac{80\,km}{2\,hours} = 40\,km/hour \]

Step 2: Calculate the Time Difference Before and After Increasing Speed
If Susan had continued at the original speed, she would have been 15 minutes (or 0.25 hours) late. However, by increasing her speed by 10 km/hr, she arrived 36 minutes earlier than planned. This means the difference in travel time due to speeding up is 0.61 hours (36 minutes + 15 minutes).

a ) 1 : 4 , b ) 4 : 3 , c ) 6 : 7 , d ) 3 : 5 , e ) 2 : 1
assistant
Rationale: Given that 15% of a equals 30% of b, we can express this relationship algebraically as:
\[0.15a = 0.30b\]

To find the ratio of \(a\) to \(b\), let's solve for one variable in terms of the other.

\[0.15a = 0.30b\]
Divide both sides by 0.15:
\[a = \frac{0.30}{0.15}b\]
\[a = 2b\]

This means that for every unit of \(b\), \(a\) is twice as much. Thus, the ratio of \(a\) to \(b\) is \(2:1\).

a ) 3 , b ) 4.5 , c ) 4 , d ) 3.5 , e ) 5
assistant
Rationale: To determine the total tax Jill paid as a percentage of the total amount she spent (excluding taxes), we first need to calculate the tax paid on each category of her spending and then divide the total tax by the total amount spent before adding any taxes. 

Let's assume the total amount Jill spent (excluding taxes) is $100 for simplicity.

- Clothing: 25% of $100 = $25. The tax on clothing is 10% of $25 = $2.5.
- Food: 25% of $100 = $25. There is no tax on food.
- Other items: 50% of $100 = $50. The tax on other items is 2% of $50 = $1.

Total tax paid = $2.5 + $0 + $1 = $3.5

a ) 1 / 4 , b ) 3 / 8 , c ) 1 / 2 , d ) 5 / 8 , e ) 3 / 4
assistant
Rationale: To find the probability that \(e(e+1)(e+2)\) is divisible by 8 for an integer \(e\) chosen from 1 to 96, we need to understand under what conditions this product is divisible by 8. Since 8 = \(2^3\), the product must contain at least three factors of 2.

Given that \(e\), \(e+1\), and \(e+2\) are three consecutive integers, one of them must always be even, meaning it's divisible by 2. For divisibility by 8, we need to ensure there are at least two even numbers among the three, or at least one of them must be divisible by 4.

- **Divisible by 4**: For \(e\) or \(e+2\) to be divisible by 4, \(e\) can be any even number, which happens every other number. So, out of every four consecutive numbers, there are exactly two that can fulfill this condition.
  
- **Divisible by 8**: This occurs when one of the three numbers is divisible by 8. This happens less frequently than being divisible by 4 because it only happens when \(e\) itself is a multiple of 8.

a ) 5 : 1 , b ) 5 : 7 , c ) 5 : 5 , d ) 5 : 9 , e ) 5 : 3
assistant
Rationale: Let's denote the amount lent at 7% as x and the amount lent at 10% as y. We know that x + y = 6000 (since the total amount lent is Rs. 6000). The total interest earned in a year is the sum of the interest from both parts, which can be represented as 0.07x + 0.10y = 450 (since the total interest at the end of one year was Rs. 450).

We can solve these two equations to find the values of x and y. The ratio we're looking for is x:y.

First, solve for x or y in the first equation:
x + y = 6000

Second, rearrange the second equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for x in terms of y:
0.07x + 0.10y = 450 => x = (450 - 0.10y) / 0.07

Rationale: To find out how much sale the grocer must have in the sixth month to achieve an average sale of Rs. 4500, first calculate the total sale required for 6 months by multiplying the desired average by the number of months (6). Then subtract the total sale from the first 5 months from this required total.

Total sale required for 6 months = 4500 * 6 = Rs. 27000

Total sale for the first 5 months = 4435 + 4927 + 4855 + 5230 + 4562 = Rs. 24009

However, it seems there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the answer choices or the calculation process. Based on the correct process:

- Total parts = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 parts
- Value per part = Rs. 5400 / 12 = Rs. 450
- Amount for John = 2 parts = Rs. 450 * 2 = Rs. 900

The correct answer based

Rationale: To find out how to divide the profit between P and Q, we need to look at their investments and the duration for which they invested. Since both invested for the same period (2 years), the profit share will be directly proportional to their investments.

P's investment = Rs. 48,000
Q's investment = Rs. 24,000

The ratio of their investments = 48,000 : 24,000

To simplify this ratio, divide each number by the greatest common divisor, which is 24,000:

\[ \frac{48,000}{24,000} : \frac{24,000}{24,000} = 2 : 1 \]

Thus, the profit should be divided between P and Q in the ratio of 2:1.

Answer: c) 2 : 1
