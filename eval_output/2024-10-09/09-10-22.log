a ’ s speed is 20 / 13 times that of b . if a and b run a race , what part of the length of the race should a give b as a head start , so that the race ends in a dead heat ?
a ) 1 / 17 , b ) 3 / 17 , c ) 1 / 10 , d ) 7 / 20 , e ) 3 / 10
assistant
Rationale: In a race where A's speed is \( \frac{20}{13} \) times that of B, we can represent their speeds as \(v_A = \frac{20}{13}v_B\), where \(v_A\) and \(v_B\) are the speeds of A and B, respectively. Since speed is directly proportional to distance over time (\(speed = \frac{distance}{time}\)), when they run a race, we want the distances each runs to be equal at the finish line for a dead heat.

To achieve this, let's say B runs an extra distance \(h\) (head start) while A runs the full distance \(d\). The time it takes for both to finish is equal since the race ends in a dead heat. We can set up the equation based on the fact that time is distance divided by speed:

\[ \frac{d}{\frac{20}{13}v_B} = \frac{d+h}{v_B} \]

We simplify this equation to find the ratio of \(h\) to \(d\):

\[ d = \frac{20}{13} \cdot (d+h) \]

\[ \frac{1

a ) 15 , b ) 16 , c ) 14 , d ) 25 , e ) 10
assistant
Rationale: Sakshi's work rate is \( \frac{1}{30} \) of the work per day, since she can complete the work in 30 days. If Tanya is 25% more efficient than Sakshi, her work rate would be 125% of Sakshi's, or \( \frac{5}{4} \times \frac{1}{30} = \frac{1}{24} \) of the work per day.

To find the number of days Tanya takes to do the same piece of work, we take the reciprocal of her work rate:

\[ \text{Days taken by Tanya} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{24}\right)} = 24 \]

However, this answer is not among the options provided. The correct interpretation of "Tanya is 25% more efficient" in terms of work rates leads us to adjust the calculation for Tanya's efficiency correctly:

Given that Tanya is 25% more efficient, if Sakshi’s efficiency is represented as 100%, then Tanya's efficiency is 125% or \(1.25\) times Sakshi's efficiency. To find the equivalent fraction of Sakshi's work rate for Tanya:

a ) 2 , b ) 3 , c ) 4 , d ) 5 , e ) 6
assistant
To determine the number of prime factors of 28, we need to factorize 28 into its prime factors.

Prime factorization of 28:
- 28 can be divided by 2 (the smallest prime number), resulting in 14.
- 14 can be further divided by 2, resulting in 7.
- Since 7 is a prime number, we have completed our factorization.

The prime factors of 28 are 2 and 7. We have used 2 prime factors in total.

Rationale: By dividing 28 by the smallest prime numbers until we reach a prime number, we find that 28 has two distinct prime factors.

approximately how many cubic feet of water are needed to fill a circular swimming pool that is 40 feet across and 7 feet deep ?
a ) 700 , b ) 1500 , c ) 3000 , d ) 5000 , e ) 9000
assistant
Rationale: To find out the volume of water needed to fill the circular swimming pool, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is \(V = \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height (or depth in this case).

Given:
- The diameter of the pool is 40 feet, so the radius \(r = \frac{40}{2} = 20\) feet.
- The depth \(h = 7\) feet.

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[V = \pi (20)^2 \times 7\]
\[V = \pi \times 400 \times 7\]
\[V = 2800\pi\]

Now, we need to approximate \(\pi\) as \(3.14\) for practical calculation:

\[V ≈ 2800 \times 3.14\]
\[V ≈ 8792\]

This value is not exactly listed in the options, but it's closest to option e) 9000 cubic feet when considering approximations.

if p / q = 3 / 7 , then 2 p + q = ?
a ) 12 , b ) 14 , c ) 13 , d ) 15 , e ) 16
assistant
Rationale: Given that \( \frac{p}{q} = \frac{3}{7} \), we can start by finding an expression for \(p\) in terms of \(q\). From the given equation:

\[ \frac{p}{q} = \frac{3}{7} \]

Multiplying both sides by \(q\) gives:

\[ p = \frac{3q}{7} \]

Now, to find the value of \(2p + q\), substitute \(p\) from the above equation into this new expression:

\[ 2p + q = 2\left(\frac{3q}{7}\right) + q \]
\[ = \frac{6q}{7} + \frac{7q}{7} \]
\[ = \frac{13q}{7} \]

Given that there is no specific value for \(q\) provided, but the question asks for an answer in terms of \(q\), the expression \(\frac{13q}{7}\) suggests none of the given options directly match without knowing \(q\). However, if the intention was to find a numerical result under the assumption that \(q\) could be simplified with \(p\) based on their ratio (from the original equation), we might have misunderstood the task's goal.

when a random experiment is conducted , the probability that event a occurs is 1 / 3 . if the random experiment is conducted 5 independent times , what is the probability that event a occurs exactly twice ?
a ) 5 / 243 , b ) 25 / 243 , c ) 64 / 243 , d ) 80 / 243 , e ) 16 / 17
assistant
Rationale: This problem can be solved by using the binomial probability formula, which is P(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where:
- n is the number of trials,
- k is the number of successful trials,
- p is the probability of success on each trial,
- (1-p) is the probability of failure on each trial, and
- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

In this case:
- n = 5 (since the experiment is conducted 5 times),
- k = 2 (since we want to find the probability of event A occurring exactly twice),
- p = 1/3 (the probability of event A occurring in one trial).

Let's calculate it step-by-step:

1. Calculate C(n, k) = C(5, 2):
C(5, 2) = 5! / [(5-2)! * 2!] = (5*4) / (2*1) = 10

2. Calculate p^k and (1-p)^(n-k):
p^k = (1/3)^2 = 1/9

a ) 145646 , b ) 236578 , c ) 645353 , d ) 456546 , e ) 220060
assistant
Rationale: Let's denote the unknown number as \(x\). We're told that when \(x\) is divided by the sum of 555 and 445, the quotient is twice their difference, and there's a remainder of 60.

Firstly, let's find the sum of 555 and 445:
\[555 + 445 = 1000\]

Next, we need to find the difference between 555 and 445:
\[555 - 445 = 110\]

Given that the quotient is twice their difference, it means:
\[Quotient = 2 \times 110 = 220\]

We also know the remainder is 60. The formula for division is:
\[x = divisor \times quotient + remainder\]

In this case, the divisor is 1000 (the sum of 555 and 445), the quotient is 220, and the remainder is 60. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:
\[x = 1000 \times 220 + 60\]
\[x = 2

if n is the greatest positive integer for which 2 ^ n is a factor of 8 ! , then n = ?
a ) 2 , b ) 4 , c ) 6 , d ) 8 , e ) 10
assistant
Rationale: To find the greatest positive integer \(n\) for which \(2^n\) is a factor of \(8!\) (8 factorial), we need to count how many times 2 appears as a factor when we expand \(8!\). 

\[8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\]

Breaking down each number into its prime factors:

- \(8 = 2^3\)
- \(7\) is prime and does not contribute to the power of 2.
- \(6 = 2 \times 3\)
- \(5\) is prime and does not contribute to the power of 2.
- \(4 = 2^2\)
- \(3\) is prime and does not contribute to the power of 2.
- \(2\) is obviously \(2^1\).

Adding up all the powers of 2 from these factorizations:

- From \(8 = 2^3\), we get 3.
- From \(4 = 2^2\), we get an additional 2.
- From \(2 = 2^1\), we get another 1.

So, the total power of 2 contributing to \(8!\) is \(3 + 2 + 1 = 6\).

60 boys can complete a work in 24 days . how many men need to complete twice the work in 20 days
a ) 144 , b ) 170 , c ) 180 , d ) 190 , e ) 200
assistant
Rationale: We can solve this by first finding the amount of work one boy does in one day (work rate), then calculating how much total work needs to be done for twice the amount mentioned, and finally determining the number of men required based on their individual work rates. The work done is directly proportional to the number of people and inversely proportional to the time taken.

Step 1: Calculate the work done by one boy in one day.
One boy's daily work rate = Total work / Number of boys / Number of days = 1 work / (60 boys * 24 days).

Step 2: Calculate the total work for twice the amount.
Total work for twice the amount = 2 * 1 work = 2 works.

Step 3: Determine the number of men required to complete the work in 20 days.
To find the number of men (M) needed, we set up a proportion based on the work rates. Since the work rate of boys is equivalent to the work rate of men, we have:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ work}}{60 \text{ boys} \times 24 \text{ days}} = \frac{2 \text{ works}}{M \text{ men} \times 20 \text{ days}} \]

Solving for M:

\[ M = \frac{(60 \times 24

a ) 27 , b ) 87 , c ) 40 , d ) 18 , e ) 17
assistant
Rationale: Let's denote the original speed of the man as \(v\) km/h and the original time taken to cover the distance as \(t\) hours. The distance covered can be expressed as the product of speed and time, i.e., distance = \(v \times t\).

From the first condition, we have that if the man moves \(3\) km/h faster, his speed becomes \(v + 3\), and the time taken is \(t - \frac{2}{3}\) hours (since \(40\) minutes = \(\frac{2}{3}\) hour). Using the distance formula again for this scenario, we get:

\[distance = (v + 3) \times \left(t - \frac{2}{3}\right)\]

Since the distance remains the same, we equate this to the original distance equation:

\[vt = (v + 3) \times \left(t - \frac{2}{3}\right)\]

From the second condition, if the man moves \(2\) km/h slower, his speed becomes \(v - 2\), and the time taken is \(t + \frac{2}{3}\) hours. Again, using the distance formula for this scenario, we get:

a ) 5 % , b ) 7 % , c ) 9 % , d ) 15 % , e ) 12 %
assistant
Rationale: To find the rate of interest, we can use the information about the compound interest for two different time periods. The formula for compound interest is \(A = P(1 + r)^t\), where \(A\) is the amount after time \(t\), \(P\) is the principal amount, \(r\) is the rate of interest per period, and \(t\) is the time in periods.

Given:
- Amount after 2 years = Rs. 17640
- Amount after 3 years = Rs. 20286

First, let's calculate the interest earned in the third year by subtracting the amount after 2 years from the amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Interest in 3rd year} = 20286 - 17640 = 2646 \]

This interest earned in the third year includes one year's interest compounded on the principal amount. Since this interest is calculated annually, we can find the rate by using the fact that the interest for the third year is equal to the interest on the amount after 2 years (Rs. 17640) for one year.

Let's denote the principal amount as \(P\), the rate of interest as \(r\) (in decimal

if a square mirror has a 20 - inch diagonal , what is the approximate perimeter t of the mirror , in inches ?
a ) 40 , b ) 60 , c ) 80 , d ) 100 , e ) 120
assistant
Rationale: To find the perimeter of a square with a diagonal, we can use the relationship between the side length (s) of the square and its diagonal (d), which is given by \(d = s\sqrt{2}\). Rearranging this formula to solve for \(s\) gives us \(s = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}\).

Given that the diagonal \(d = 20\) inches, we substitute this value into our formula:

\[s = \frac{20}{\sqrt{2}}\]

Simplifying this expression,

\[s = \frac{20}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{20\sqrt{2}}{2} = 10\sqrt{2}\]

The perimeter (P) of a square is given by \(P = 4s\), so substituting \(s = 10\sqrt{2}\) into this formula,

\[P = 4 \times 10\sqrt{2} = 40\sqrt{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{2}\) is approximately equal to 1.414, 

\[P ≈ 40 \times 1.414 = 56.56\]

Thus, the closest answer is b) 60 inches.

Rationale: Let's denote the original speed Susan was driving at as \(v\) km/hr. Given that she drove for 2 hours initially and covered 80 km, we can deduce her initial speed as \(v = \frac{80}{2} = 40\) km/hr. If she maintained this speed, she would be 15 minutes (or 0.25 hours) late. She then increased her speed by 10 km/hr, making it \(v + 10 = 50\) km/hr.

After increasing her speed, she arrived 36 minutes earlier than planned. The difference in travel time due to speeding up is \(0.6\) hours (36 minutes). We know the total travel time with the increased speed was less than intended by \(0.6\) hours. 

Let's denote the total intended travel time as \(T\) hours. The distance \(D\) can be calculated using the formula \(D = vt\), where \(v\) is the speed and \(t\) is the time. Initially, we have:

a ) 0.225 , b ) 0.228 , c ) 0.254 , d ) 0.256 , e ) none
assistant
Rationale: The given proportion equation is 0.45 : x :: 4 : 2. This means that 0.45/x = 4/2. We can solve this equation for x by cross-multiplying.

Answer: First, we cross-multiply to get:
\[ 0.45 * 2 = x * 4 \]

Then we simplify:
\[ 0.9 = 4x \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{0.9}{4} = 0.225 \]

So, the answer is a) 0.225.
correct answer: a

the area of a parallelogram is 72 cm ^ 2 and its altitude is twice the corresponding base . what is the length of the base ?
['a ) 1 cm', 'b ) 3 cm', 'c ) 6 cm', 'd ) 4 cm', 'e ) 2 cm']
assistant
Rationale: Given that the area of a parallelogram is 72 cm² and its altitude is twice the corresponding base, we can use the formula for the area of a parallelogram, which is \(Area = base \times height\). Let's denote the base as \(b\) and the height (altitude) as \(h\). According to the given information, \(h = 2b\). Substituting \(h = 2b\) into the formula for the area of a parallelogram, we get \(72 = b \times 2b\), or \(72 = 2b^2\). Solving this equation will give us the value of the base \(b\).

Answer: First, solve for \(b\): \(72 = 2b^2\), dividing both sides by 2 gives \(36 = b^2\). Taking the square root of both sides yields \(b = 6\) cm.

Therefore, the length of the base is \(c) 6 cm\).
correct answer: c

what is the rate percent when the simple interest on rs . 2000 amount to rs . 320 in 4 years ?
a ) 4.5 % , b ) 4.25 % , c ) 4 % , d ) 4.3 % , e ) 4.1 %
assistant
Rationale: To find the rate percent, we use the formula for Simple Interest (SI), which is:
\[ \text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]
where \(P\) is the principal amount, \(R\) is the rate of interest per annum, and \(T\) is the time in years. We are given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = Rs. 2000
- Simple Interest (\(SI\)) = Rs. 320
- Time (\(T\)) = 4 years

Plugging these values into the formula:
\[ 320 = \frac{2000 \times R \times 4}{100} \]

Solving for \(R\):
\[ 320 = \frac{8000R}{100} \]
\[ 320 = 80R \]
\[ R = \frac{320}{80} \]
\[ R = 4 \% \]

Answer: c) 4%
correct answer: c
