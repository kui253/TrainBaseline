the marked price of a book is 20 % more than the cost price . after the book is sold , the vendor realizes that he had wrongly raised the cost price by a margin of 25 % . if the marked price of the book is rs . 30 , what is the original cost price of the book ?
a ) rs . 30 , b ) rs . 25 , c ) rs . 45 , d ) rs . 20 , e ) rs . 10<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Rationale: The question provides multiple percentages and asks us to find the original cost price of the book when the marked price (MP) is Rs. 30. We need to work through the information step-by-step.

Firstly, let's understand the relationship between the marked price (MP), the increased cost price (ICP), and the original cost price (CP).

Given:
- MP = 20% more than CP
- ICP = CP + 25% of CP

The MP is given as Rs. 30. According to the first statement:

\[ \text{MP} = \text{CP} + 20\% \times \text{CP} \]

Since MP = Rs. 30,

\[ 30 = \text{CP} + 0.2 \times \text{CP} \]
\[ 30 = 1.2 \times \text{CP} \]

To solve this problem, let's denote the distance between point A and point B as \(D\) kilometers.

First, we find the time Gary took to travel from point A to point B by car. The formula for time is \(Time = \frac{Distance}{Speed}\). So, the time taken by car is \(\frac{D}{60}\) hours.

Next, we calculate the time Gary took to travel back from point B to point A by train. The speed of the train is \(110\) km/h. Therefore, the time taken by train is \(\frac{D}{110}\) hours.

According to the problem, the trip back by train lasted \(5\) hours less than the trip by car. This gives us the equation:
\[\frac{D}{60} - \frac{D}{110} = 5\]

To solve for \(D\), we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is \(660\) (the

a ) 3.5 , b ) 6 , c ) 8 , d ) 7 , e ) 9<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, let's denote the unknown number as \(x\).

According to the problem, we have the following steps:
1. The number is doubled: \(2x\).
2. Then 9 is added: \(2x + 9\).
3. Finally, the result is tripled to become 81: \(3(2x + 9) = 81\).

Now, we can solve for \(x\) using the equation:

\[3(2x + 9) = 81\]

First, distribute the 3 on the left side of the equation:

\[6x + 27 = 81\]

Next, subtract 27 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \(x\):

\[6x = 81 - 27\]
\[6x = 54\]

Finally, divide both sides by 6 to solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{54}{6}\]
\[x = 9\]

Therefore, the answer is \(x = 9\), which corresponds to option e) 9.

a ) 16.5 , b ) 19.2 , c ) 16.4 , d ) 16.8 , e ) 16.1<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total distance that the train has to cover to completely cross the bridge. This includes the length of the train plus the length of the bridge.

Total distance = Length of train + Length of bridge
= 150 m + 170 m
= 320 m

Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/h (kilometers per hour) to m/s (meters per second) for consistency with the units used for distance:

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s)
= 60 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600)
= 60 * 1000 / 3600
= 16.667 m/s (approximately)

Now, using the formula for time, which is Time = Distance / Speed, we can calculate how long it takes for the train to cross the bridge:

Time = Total distance / Speed

To solve this problem, let's denote:
- \(v\) as the speed of the train,
- \(L\) as the length of the train.

From the first statement, we know that the train passes a pole in 10 seconds. The distance covered when passing the pole is equal to the length of the train, \(L\). Since distance = speed \(\times\) time, we have:
\[L = v \times 10 \tag{1}\]

From the second statement, we know that the train takes 20 seconds to pass a 50m long platform. The total distance covered when passing the platform includes the length of the train plus the length of the platform. Thus:
\[L + 50 = v \times 20 \tag{2}\]

Let's substitute equation (1) into equation (2):
\[v \times 10 + 50 = v \times 20\]
\[50 = v \times 10\]
\[v = 5 \text{ m/s}\]

Now, substitute the value of \(v\) back into equation (1):

Let's denote the son's current age as \(S\) and the father's current age as \(F\). From the information given:

1. The father is 24 years older than his son: \(F = S + 24\).
2. In three years, the father's age will be twice the age of his son: \(F + 3 = 2(S + 3)\).

Substituting the expression for \(F\) from the first equation into the second equation gives:

\[S + 24 + 3 = 2(S + 3)\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[S + 27 = 2S + 6\]

Rationale: The question states that the horse catches up with the pony 8 hours after the pony starts running. Since the horse takes 12 hours to reach the pony, it means the pony has been running for \(8 + 12 = 20\) hours when the horse finally catches up.

Given that the average speed of the horse is 320 km/h, we can calculate how far the horse traveled by multiplying its speed by the time it took to catch the pony:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 320 \, \text{km/h} \times 12 \, \text{h} = 3840 \, \text{km} \]

This distance is also the total distance covered by the pony since the time it started running. To find the average speed of the pony, we divide this distance by the total time the pony was running:

Let's denote the cost price of the cupboard as \(C\).

Vijay sells the cupboard at 10% below its cost price, which means he sells it for \(90\%\) of \(C\), or \(0.9C\).

If Vijay had sold the cupboard for Rs. 1500 more, his selling price would have been \((0.9C + 1500)\). At this new selling price, he would have made a profit of 10%, meaning the selling price equals \(110\%\) of \(C\), or \(1.1C\).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[0.9C + 1500 = 1.1C\]

Solving for \(C\):
\[1500 = 1.1C - 0.9C\]

Rationale: To find out how many smaller cubes of 8 cm edge can be cut out from a larger cube of 16 cm edge, we can calculate the volume of both cubes and then divide the volume of the larger cube by the volume of the smaller cube.

The volume of a cube is calculated as \(V = a^3\), where \(a\) is the edge length of the cube.

For the larger cube with an edge of 16 cm, its volume \(V_{large} = 16^3 = 4096 \, \text{cm}^3\).

For the smaller cube with an edge of 8 cm, its volume \(V_{small} = 8^3 = 512 \, \text{cm}^3\).

Dividing the volume of the larger cube by the volume of the smaller cube gives us the number of smaller cubes that can fit into the larger one:

\[ \frac{V_{large}}{V_{small}} = \frac{4096}{512} = 8 \]

Rationale: We are presented with a classic example of capture-recapture method used in ecology to estimate population sizes. The principle is that the proportion of marked (tagged) individuals in the second sample should be approximately the same as the proportion of all marked individuals in the total population.

From the given information:
- First sample: 55 fish caught, tagged, and released.
- Second sample: 55 fish caught, 2 of which were found to be tagged.

Given this setup, we can set up the following proportion to solve for the total population (P):

\[ \frac{Number\ of\ tagged\ in\ second\ catch}{Total\ number\ caught\ in\ second\ catch} = \frac{Total\ number\ of\ tagged\ fish}{Total\ population} \]

To find the least possible positive difference between \(n\) (the number of players scoring 2 points) and \(m\) (the number of players scoring 5 points), given that their total sum of scores equals 50, we can set up an equation based on the information provided:

\[2n + 5m = 50\]

Our goal is to minimize the absolute difference between \(n\) and \(m\), which can be represented as \(|n - m|\).

To minimize this difference, we aim to balance the contribution of players scoring 2 points with those scoring 5 points. Let's explore different combinations:

### Scenario 1: Maximize one type of score while minimizing the other.

#### Minimizing \(n\) while maximizing \(m\):

- If all points come from 5-point scorers:
\[5m = 50 \Rightarrow m = 10\]
This gives no 2-point scorers (\(n = 0\)), resulting in a difference of \(10 - 0 = 10\).

a ) 15 min , b ) 18 min , c ) 16 min , d ) 20 min , e ) 40 min<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out for how many minutes the bus stops per hour, we can calculate the difference in time between traveling at the given speeds with and without stoppages.

Given that the average speed excluding stoppages is 120 km/hr and including stoppages is 40 km/hr, the reduction in speed due to stoppages is:

\(120 \, \text{km/hr} - 40 \, \text{km/hr} = 80 \, \text{km/hr}\)

This means for every hour of travel, effectively, the bus covers only 80 km less than it would if there were no stoppages. 

Since speed is distance over time, we can rearrange this to find time:

\(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{80 \, \text{km}}{80 \, \text{km/hr}} = 1 \, \text{hour}\)

Therefore, for every hour of travel, the bus stops for an hour. However, this is

Rationale: To find the average of the first three multiples of 5, we must first identify what these multiples are. The first multiple of 5 is 5 itself (since \(5 \times 1 = 5\)), the second multiple is 10 (\(5 \times 2 = 10\)), and the third multiple is 15 (\(5 \times 3 = 15\)).

Once we have identified these multiples, calculating their average involves summing them up and then dividing by the number of values (in this case, 3).

Summing them up gives us \(5 + 10 + 15 = 30\).

Dividing this sum by 3 (the total number of values) gives us \(30 / 3 = 10\).

Answer: a) 10
correct answer: a

in a box of 11 pens , a total of 3 are defective . if a customer buys 2 pens selected at random from the box , what is the probability that neither pen will be defective ?
a ) 28 / 55 , b ) 19 / 33 , c ) 7 / 11 , d ) 4 / 7 , e ) 3 / 5<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Rationale: To find the probability that neither of the two pens chosen is defective, we can calculate the probability of selecting a non-defective pen on each draw and multiply these probabilities together, assuming the selection is done without replacement.

There are 8 non-defective pens out of 11 total pens.

Probability of selecting a non-defective pen first: \( \frac{8}{11} \)

After removing one non-defective pen, there are now 7 non-defective pens left out of a total of 10 pens:

Probability of selecting another non-defective pen: \( \frac{7}{10} \)

Multiplying these probabilities gives us the probability of both events happening (selecting two non-defective pens):

\[ P(\text{Non-defective on 1st AND Non-defective on 2nd}) = \frac{8}{11} \times \frac{7}{10} \]

Answer: a) \( \frac{28}{55} \)<|eot_id|>

thirty percent of the members of a swim club have passed the lifesaving test . among the members who have not passed the test , 26 have taken the preparatory course and 65 have not taken the course . how many members are there in the swim club ?
a ) 60 , b ) 80 , c ) 100 , d ) 130 , e ) 140<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Rationale: Let's denote the total number of members in the swim club as \(x\). According to the problem, 30% of these members have passed the lifesaving test, which means that 70% have not. Out of those who have not passed the test, some have taken the preparatory course and others haven't. The problem states that 26 have taken the course and 65 have not. This gives us the equation for the 70% who have not passed the test: \(0.7x = 26 + 65\).

Solving for \(x\) will give us the total number of members in the swim club.

\[0.7x = 91\]

\[x = \frac{91}{0.7}\]

\[x = 130\]

Therefore, the total number of members in the swim club is 130.

Answer: d) 130
correct answer: d

a rectangular with dimensions 35 inches by 45 inches is to be divided into squares of equal size . which of the following could be a length of a side of the squares ?
['a ) a ) 4 inches', 'b ) b ) 6 inches', 'c ) c ) 5 inches', 'd ) d ) 8 inches', 'e ) e ) 10 inches']<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find out which of these options can be a side length for the squares formed from dividing the rectangle, we need to check if the side lengths (35 inches and 45 inches) are divisible by each of the given options without leaving a remainder.

Rationale:

1. **Option a)** $4$ inches: Check divisibility of both sides by $4$. 
   - $35 \div 4 = 8.75$ (not divisible)
   - $45 \div 4 = 11.25$ (not divisible)

2. **Option b)** $6$ inches: Check divisibility of both sides by $6$. 
   - $35 \div 6 = 5.833...$ (not divisible)
   - $45 \div 6 = 7.5$ (not divisible)

3. **Option c)** $5$ inches: Check divisibility of both sides by $5$.
   - $35 \div 5 = 7$ (divisible)
   -
correct answer: c
