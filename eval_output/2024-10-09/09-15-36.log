a ) 8 , b ) 9 , c ) 10 , d ) 11 , e ) 12<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sum of three consecutive integers can be represented as \(x + (x + 1) + (x + 2)\), where \(x\) is the first integer. Simplifying this gives \(3x + 3\). Setting this equal to 30, we have:

\[3x + 3 = 30\]

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

\[3x = 27\]

Dividing by 3:

\[x = 9\]

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 9, 10, and 11. The greatest of these is 11.

a circle graph shows how the budget of a certain company was spent : 55 percent for salaries , 9 percent for research and development , 5 percent for utilities , 4 percent for equipment , 2 percent for supplies , and the remainder for transportation . if the area of each sector of the graph is proportional to the percent of the budget it represents , how many degrees of the circle are used to represent transportation ?
a ) 18 ° , b ) 36 ° , c ) 54 ° , d ) 72 ° , e ) 90 °<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find the number of degrees representing transportation in the circle graph, we first calculate the percentage of the budget allocated to transportation. We subtract the sum of the percentages of the other categories from 100%:

\[100\% - (55\% + 9\% + 5\% + 4\% + 2\%) = 100\% - 75\% = 25\%\]

Since the area of each sector is proportional to the percent of the budget it represents, the degrees used to represent transportation can be found by calculating 25% of the total degrees in a circle, which is 360 degrees:

\[25\% \times 360° = \frac{25}{100} \times 360° = 90°\]

Therefore, the number of degrees used to represent transportation is 90

a rectangular field is to be fenced on three sides leaving a side of 20 feet uncovered . if the area of the field is 680 sq . feet , how many feet of fencing will be required ?
a ) 34 , b ) 40 , c ) 68 , d ) 88 , e ) 98<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, let's first determine the dimensions of the rectangle.

We know that the field has one side that is 20 feet long and its area is 680 square feet. Let's denote the length (the 20 feet side) as \(L\) and the width as \(W\). The area of a rectangle is calculated as \(A = L \times W\).

Given:
- \(A = 680\) sq. ft
- \(L = 20\) ft

Substituting the known values into the area formula gives us:
\[680 = 20 \times W\]

Solving for \(W\):
\[W = \frac{680}{20} = 34\] ft

This means the field's width is 34 feet.

Since the field is to be fenced on three sides, we need to consider two widths and one length for the fencing (because one length side is not being fenced over). Therefore, the total length of the fencing required is:
\[2W + L = 2(34) + 20 = 68 +

a ) 124 % , b ) 120 % , c ) 96 % , d ) 80 % , e ) 64 %<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, let's start with Juan's income, which we'll call \(J\).

Juan's income = \(J\)

Tim's income is 40% less than Juan's income, so:
\[ \text{Tim's income} = J - 0.4J = 0.6J \]

Mary's income is 60% more than Tim's income, so:
\[ \text{Mary's income} = 0.6J + 0.6(0.6J) = 0.6J + 0.36J = 0.96J \]

We're asked to find what percent of Juan's income Mary's income is. To do this, we calculate:
\[ \frac{\text{Mary's income}}{\text{Juan's income}} = \frac{0.96J}{J} = 0.96 \]

Converting the decimal to a percentage:
\[ 0.96 \times 100\% = 96\% \]

To find the length of the garden, we need to calculate how much space is occupied by the mango trees and the distances between them.

Given:
- There are 12 rows and 14 columns of mango trees.
- The distance between two trees is 2 meters.
- A distance of 1 meter is left from all sides of the boundary of the garden.

Firstly, let's calculate the length covered by the trees and the distances between them. For the rows:
- Each row has 14 trees, so there are 13 gaps between these trees (since the first tree doesn't have a gap before it and the last tree doesn't have a gap after it).
- Each gap = 2 meters, so total gap distance for rows = \(13 \times 2 = 26\) meters.

For the columns:
- Each column has 12 trees, so there are 11 gaps between these trees.
- Each gap = 2 meters, so total gap distance for columns = \(11 \times 2 = 22\) meters.

how many positive integers less than 250 are multiple of 4 but not multiples of 6 ?
a ) 20 , b ) 31 , c ) 42 , d ) 53 , e ) 64<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find how many positive integers less than 250 are multiples of 4 but not multiples of 6:

First, identify multiples of 4:
- The smallest multiple of 4 less than 250 is 4 itself, and the largest is 248 (since \(250 \div 4 = 62.5\), thus the last multiple before exceeding 250 is 62 * 4 = 248).
- To calculate the number of multiples of 4 in this range, use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\), where \(a_n = 248\), \(a_1 = 4\), and \(d = 4\). Solve for \(n\):
\[248 = 4 + (n - 1)4\]
\[244 = 4(n - 1)\]
\[61 = n - 1\]
\[n = 62\]

Next, consider numbers that are multiples of both 4 and 6 (i.e., multiples of 12, since 12 is the least common multiple of 4 and 6

Let's denote the amount of additional money Barbata needs to invest at 8% as \(x\).

The total annual income from the initial investment is:
\[2600 \times 0.05 = \$130\]

If she wants the total annual income to be equal to 6% of her entire investment, then the equation for the total annual income can be written as:
\[\frac{2600 + x}{2600 + x} \times 0.06\]

Since this should equal the sum of the incomes from both investments, we have:
\[130 + 0.08x = 0.06(2600 + x)\]

Expanding and solving for \(x\):
\[130 + 0.08x = 156 + 0.06x\]
\[0.08x - 0.06x = 156 - 130\]
\[0.02x = 26\]

To find the value of \(k\), we need to use the slope formula:

\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Given that the slope \(m = k\) and the points are \((-3, -4)\) and \((3, k)\), we can substitute these into the formula:

\[ k = \frac{k - (-4)}{3 - (-3)} \]

\[ k = \frac{k + 4}{6} \]

Multiplying both sides by 6 to get rid of the denominator:

\[ 6k = k + 4 \]

Subtract \(k\) from both sides:

\[ 5k = 4 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ k = \frac{4}{5} \]

Therefore, the answer is \(c) 4/5\).

a ) 6 cm , b ) 4 cm , c ) 8 cm , d ) 3 cm , e ) 9 cm<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to understand that volume is conserved during the transformation of the material from a sphere to a wire (assuming no loss due to melting or other processes). 

The volume of the sphere can be calculated using the formula \(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

For the sphere:
\[V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi (12)^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi (1728) = 2304\pi \text{ cm}^3\]

The volume of the wire can be calculated by multiplying the cross-sectional area (\(A\)) by its length (\(L\)). The cross-sectional area is given by \(\pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the wire.

Given that the radius of the cross-section of the wire is 24 cm, the cross-sectional area is:
\[A = \pi (24)^2 = 576\pi \text{ cm}^2\]

Since the volume of the sphere equals the volume of the wire (due to conservation of

To solve this problem, let's calculate the rates at which pipes A and B fill the cistern and then determine how long it takes for the cistern to be filled when both pipes are open.

Pipe A fills the cistern in 10 minutes, so its rate is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the cistern per minute.
Pipe B fills the cistern in 15 minutes, so its rate is \(\frac{1}{15}\) of the cistern per minute.

For the first 3 minutes, both pipes are open, so their combined rate is \(\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{15}\). To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which would be 30:

\[

To solve this problem, we first find out the production rate of one machine and then apply it to the scenario with 25 machines producing 100 units.

Given that 5 machines can produce 20 units in 10 hours:

1. **Find the production rate per machine**: Since 5 machines produce 20 units in 10 hours, one machine produces \( \frac{20}{5} = 4 \) units in 10 hours.
2. **Determine the production rate for 25 machines**: If one machine produces 4 units in 10 hours, then 25 machines produce \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) units in 10 hours (because they are working simultaneously).
3. **Find out how long it takes to produce 100 units with 25 machines**: Since 25 machines can produce 100 units in 10 hours, it directly implies that it takes 10 hours for them to produce 100 units.

a ) 18 , b ) 8 , c ) 12 , d ) 16 , e ) none of these<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To find the greatest number that leaves the same remainder when dividing 21, 57, and 105, we can approach this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the differences between these numbers.

First, calculate the differences:
- Between 57 and 21: \(57 - 21 = 36\)
- Between 105 and 57: \(105 - 57 = 48\)
- Between 105 and 21: \(105 - 21 = 84\)

Now, find the GCD of these three differences:
